# Why I analyze the data from Airbnb
I choose this data because I'm interested at sharing economy and big data. 
In 2020 Olympic will be held in Japan and existing hotels won't be enough for domestic and global tourists. 
Therefore, sharing houses have demands for solving that issues. Maybe this will be a fortune as your business.
Do you want to join Airbnb? Do you think you make money from this or not?
If you join Airbnb as a newbie, how do you start?

# At first, how can you sell your peoperties?
The most interesting thing must be ... whether you can get customers or not. Especially at the first time.
How do people who sells their properties well make the business? We will compare the tendency between well sold properties and the opposit.

# Questions for this data
## 1. What changes the price?
**We need to check correlation**
- largeness?
- location?

## 2. How can we get more money from AirBnB business?
 - distributions of properties price
 - 2-1) What makes more booked listings? or less booked listings?
     - cheap?
 - 2-2) What makes good review scores by customers?

# Result
## Question 1 : What changes the price?
- location(city), room_type and accommodates effect the change of prices.

## Question 2 : How can we get more money from AirBnB business?
 - distributions of properties price
 - **2-1) What makes more booked listings? or less booked listings?**
     - Can be said properties with under 300 dollars are easier booked
 - **2-2) What makes good review scores by customers?**
  - Even not well booked had as good scores as well booked. It seems like no link between how much booked and how good the review is. If you believe the review scores, you can say how much booked doesn't effect on the review scores.
